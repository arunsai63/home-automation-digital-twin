üîó **Live Demo**: [https://arunsai63.github.io/home-automation-digital-twin/](https://arunsai63.github.io/home-automation-digital-twin/)

## Overview

This project implements a digital twin of a smart room using Three.js for 3D visualization and vanilla JavaScript for real-time sensor data simulation. It demonstrates IoT concepts without requiring actual hardware, making it ideal for prototyping, education, and showcasing smart building capabilities.

## Features

### 3D Environment

- Orbit camera controls for navigation with optimized initial view
- Dynamic lighting system with multiple scenes (Normal, Dimmed, Focus, Party)
- Real-time visual feedback for all controls
- Live camera position display

### Smart Room Modes
- **Home Mode** üè†: Optimal comfort settings for daily use
- **Away Mode** üö™: Energy-saving mode with all devices off
- **Sleep Mode** üåô: Quiet environment with lights off and blinds closed
- **Work Mode** üíº: Bright focused lighting with computer active
- **Eco Mode** üå±: Minimal energy consumption
- **Party Mode** üéâ: Dynamic color-changing lights

### Sensor Simulation

- Humidity tracking (40-70%)
- CO2 level detection (400-2000 ppm)
- Ambient light measurement (0-1000 lux)
- Occupancy detection (0-5 people)
- Noise level monitoring (30-80 dB)

### Control Systems
- Smart lighting control with scene presets
- HVAC control with temperature adjustment (16-30¬∞C)
- Animated ceiling fan with speed control
- Window blinds operation
- Workstation power management
- Climate control slider
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access

### Data Visualization
- Real-time sensor displays with progress indicators
- Historical trend charts with multiple metrics
- Tab-based chart switching (Temperature, Humidity, CO2, Light)
- Threshold-based alerting system
- Performance metrics overlay (FPS, Memory, Particles)

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

```
app.js              - Application initialization and lifecycle
room3d.js           - Three.js scene, 3D objects, animations, and human figures
sensors.js          - Sensor data simulation and threshold monitoring
controls.js         - User interaction, device control, and smart automation
charts.js           - Data visualization, charting, and performance metrics
style.css           - Glass morphism UI, responsive design, and animations
index.html          - Application structure with semantic HTML5
```

## Technical Stack

- **Three.js r128** - 3D graphics rendering
- **Chart.js 3.x** - Data visualization
- **Vanilla JavaScript ES6** - Core application logic
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup

## Configuration

### Sensor Parameters

Modify sensor ranges in `sensors.js`:

```javascript
const sensorRanges = {
    temperature: { min: 18, max: 28, unit: '¬∞C' },
    humidity: { min: 40, max: 70, unit: '%' },
    co2: { min: 400, max: 2000, unit: ' ppm' }
};
```

### Alert Thresholds

Adjust alert triggers in `sensors.js`:

```javascript
const alertThresholds = {
    temperature: { low: 18, high: 26 },
    co2: { low: 400, high: 1000 },
    noiseLevel: { low: 30, high: 70 }
};
```

### 3D Scene Customization

Modify room layout in `room3d.js`:

```javascript
// Adjust furniture positions (x, y, z coordinates)
deskGroup.position.set(-1, 0, -2);
chairGroup.position.set(-1, 0, -1);
```

## Recent Updates

- **Enhanced 3D Scene**: Added colorful walls with procedural textures, seated human figures with arm animations
- **Ceiling Fan**: Animated ceiling fan with real-time control and default ON state
